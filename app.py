Minor forgetfulness related to aging may occur but does not impair daily activities. Neuropsychological tests typically fall within normal ranges. Regular assessments help monitor for early signs of cognitive change.",

Individuals remain largely independent but may begin using memory aids or require slightly more effort in complex tasks. Changes are often detected through close observation or cognitive screening tools. It may correspond to the earliest stage of Alzheimerâ€™s or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).",
