# Alzheimeer-s-disease-prediction
This project is an AI-driven web application that aims to assist in the early detection and classification of Alzheimerâ€™s disease by analyzing MRI brain scans. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the system is designed to automatically identify and categorize brain images into four stages of the disease: Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented. The core of the system consists of two main models: a U-Net model for effective image segmentation, which helps isolate relevant brain regions from the MRI scan, and a ResNet-101 model, enhanced with transfer learning, for high-accuracy classification. The integration of these models allows the system to focus on the most significant features in the brain and make reliable predictions.

The user interacts with the system through a Flask-based web interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. Users can register, log in securely, and upload their MRI images directly through the web portal. Once an image is uploaded, it undergoes preprocessing using OpenCV, including resizing, normalization, and grayscale conversion. The processed image is then passed through the trained model, and the prediction result, along with a confidence score, is displayed to the user in real-time. SQLite is used to manage user credentials and store their prediction history for future reference.

The project demonstrates the practical application of Python and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras in solving real-world healthcare problems. With a prediction accuracy of 96.06%, this system can significantly aid medical professionals by reducing diagnostic time and supporting early intervention. It also opens doors for scalable solutions in remote or under-resourced areas. Future improvements include integrating Grad-CAM for visual explanations of model decisions, deploying a mobile-compatible version, and expanding the training dataset to cover more diverse patient profiles, further enhancing its clinical relevance and impact.
